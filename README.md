## Project Goal

I want to make it easy to get a simple webshop up and running super quickly.
This doesn't mean it can't be used for other purposes as well!
Also this project uses a lot of things that I probably will need in other projects, so this makes it a good refernce to check back on later.


## Features

- Okay/Good looking interface
- Working shopping cart
- Good mobile version
- Search functionality

## Not working/implemented
- Payment checkout
- Search on mobile, the element doesn't scale well (yet)
- lazy loading catalog
- custom images for products
- way to filter in a catalog
